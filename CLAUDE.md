## 📚 Fleet Standards

### Identifying users

Identify users by git credentials and use their actual name. Use "you/your" when speaking directly; use names when referencing contributions.

### Parallel Claude sessions

This repo may have multiple Claude sessions running concurrently against the same checkout, against parallel git worktrees, or against sibling clones. Several common git operations are hostile to that.

**Forbidden in the primary checkout:**

- `git stash` — shared store; another session can `pop` yours
- `git add -A` / `git add .` — sweeps files from other sessions
- `git checkout <branch>` / `git switch <branch>` — yanks the working tree out from under another session
- `git reset --hard` against a non-HEAD ref — discards another session's commits

**Required for branch work:** spawn a worktree.

```bash
git worktree add -b <task-branch> ../<repo>-<task> main
cd ../<repo>-<task>
# edit / commit / push from here; primary checkout is untouched
git worktree remove ../<repo>-<task>
```

**Required for staging:** surgical `git add <specific-file>`. Never `-A` / `.`.

**Never revert files you didn't touch.** If `git status` shows unfamiliar changes, leave them — they belong to another session, an upstream pull, or a hook side-effect.

The umbrella rule: never run a git command that mutates state belonging to a path other than the file you just edited.

### Public-surface hygiene

🚨 The four rules below have hooks that re-print the rule on every public-surface `git` / `gh` command. The rules apply even when the hooks are not installed.

- **Real customer / company names** — never write one into a commit, PR, issue, comment, or release note. Replace with `Acme Inc` or rewrite the sentence to not need the reference. (No enumerated denylist exists — a denylist is itself a leak.)
- **Private repos / internal project names** — never mention. Omit the reference entirely; don't substitute "an internal tool" — the placeholder is a tell.
- **Linear refs** — never put `SOC-123`/`ENG-456`/Linear URLs in code, comments, or PR text. Linear lives in Linear.
- **Publish / release / build-release workflows** — never `gh workflow run|dispatch` or `gh api …/dispatches`. Dispatches are irrevocable. The user runs them manually.

### Commits & PRs

- Conventional Commits `<type>(<scope>): <description>` — NO AI attribution.
- **When adding commits to an OPEN PR**, update the PR title and description to match the new scope. Use `gh pr edit <num> --title … --body …`. The reviewer should know what's in the PR without scrolling commits.
- **Replying to Cursor Bugbot** — reply on the inline review-comment thread, not as a detached PR comment: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies -X POST -f body=…`.

### Programmatic Claude calls

🚨 Workflows / skills / scripts that invoke `claude` CLI or `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` MUST set all four lockdown flags: `tools`, `allowedTools`, `disallowedTools`, `permissionMode: 'dontAsk'`. Never `default` mode in headless contexts. Never `bypassPermissions`. See `.claude/skills/programmatic-claude-lockdown/SKILL.md`.

### Tooling

- **Package manager**: `pnpm`. Run scripts via `pnpm run foo --flag`, never `foo:bar`. After `package.json` edits, `pnpm install`.
- 🚨 NEVER use `npx`, `pnpm dlx`, or `yarn dlx` — use `pnpm exec <package>` or `pnpm run <script>` # socket-hook: allow npx
- **`minimumReleaseAge`** — never add packages to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in CI. Locally, ASK before adding (security control).
- **Backward compatibility** — FORBIDDEN to maintain. Actively remove when encountered.

### Code style

- **Comments** — default to none. Write one only when the WHY is non-obvious to a senior engineer.
- **Completion** — never leave `TODO` / `FIXME` / `XXX` / shims / stubs / placeholders. Finish 100%. If too large for one pass, ask before cutting scope.
- **`null` vs `undefined`** — use `undefined`. `null` is allowed only for `__proto__: null` or external API requirements.
- **Object literals** — `{ __proto__: null, ... }` for config / return / internal-state.
- **Imports** — no dynamic `await import()`. `node:fs` cherry-picks (`existsSync`, `promises as fs`); `path` / `os` / `url` / `crypto` use default imports. Exception: `fileURLToPath` from `node:url`.
- **HTTP** — never `fetch()`. Use `httpJson` / `httpText` / `httpRequest` from `@socketsecurity/lib/http-request`.
- **File existence** — `existsSync` from `node:fs`. Never `fs.access` / `fs.stat`-for-existence / async `fileExists` wrapper.
- **File deletion** — route every delete through `safeDelete()` / `safeDeleteSync()` from `@socketsecurity/lib/fs`. Never `fs.rm` / `fs.unlink` / `fs.rmdir` / `rm -rf` directly — even for one known file.
- **Edits** — Edit tool, never `sed` / `awk`.
- **Inclusive language** — see [`docs/references/inclusive-language.md`](docs/references/inclusive-language.md) for the substitution table.
- **Sorting** — sort lists alphanumerically; details in [`docs/references/sorting.md`](docs/references/sorting.md). When in doubt, sort.
- **`Promise.race` / `Promise.any` in loops** — never re-race a pool that survives across iterations (the handlers stack). See `.claude/skills/promise-race-pitfall/SKILL.md`.

### 1 path, 1 reference

A path is constructed exactly once. Everywhere else references the constructed value.

- **Within a package**: every script imports its own `scripts/paths.mts`. No `path.join('build', mode, …)` outside that module.
- **Across packages**: package B imports package A's `paths.mts` via the workspace `exports` field. Never `path.join(PKG, '..', '<sibling>', 'build', …)`.
- **Workflows / Dockerfiles / shell** can't `import` TS — construct once, reference by output / `ENV` / variable.

Three-level enforcement: `.claude/hooks/path-guard/` blocks at edit time; `scripts/check-paths.mts` is the whole-repo gate run by `pnpm check`; `/path-guard` is the audit-and-fix skill. Find the canonical owner and import from it.

### Background Bash

Never use `Bash(run_in_background: true)` for test / build commands (`vitest`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, `tsgo`). Backgrounded runs you don't poll get abandoned and leak Node workers. Background mode is for dev servers and long migrations whose results you'll consume. If a run hangs, kill it: `pkill -f "vitest/dist/workers"`. The `.claude/hooks/stale-process-sweeper/` `Stop` hook reaps true orphans as a safety net.

### Judgment & self-evaluation

- If the request is based on a misconception, say so before executing.
- If you spot an adjacent bug, flag it: "I also noticed X — want me to fix it?"
- Fix warnings (lint / type / build / runtime) when you see them — don't leave them for later.
- **Default to perfectionist** when you have latitude. "Works now" ≠ "right."
- Before calling done: perfectionist vs. pragmatist views. Default perfectionist absent a signal.
- If a fix fails twice: stop, re-read top-down, state where the mental model was wrong, try something fundamentally different.

### Error messages

An error message is UI. The reader should fix the problem from the message alone. Four ingredients in order:

1. **What** — the rule, not the fallout (`must be lowercase`, not `invalid`).
2. **Where** — exact file / line / key / field / flag.
3. **Saw vs. wanted** — the bad value and the allowed shape or set.
4. **Fix** — one imperative action (`rename the key to …`).

Use `isError` / `isErrnoException` / `errorMessage` / `errorStack` from `@socketsecurity/lib/errors` over hand-rolled checks. Use `joinAnd` / `joinOr` from `@socketsecurity/lib/arrays` for allowed-set lists. Full guidance in [`docs/references/error-messages.md`](docs/references/error-messages.md).

### Token hygiene

🚨 Never emit the raw value of any secret to tool output, commits, comments, or replies. The `.claude/hooks/token-guard/` `PreToolUse` hook blocks the deterministic patterns (literal token shapes, env dumps, `.env*` reads, unfiltered `curl -H "Authorization:"`, sensitive-name commands without redaction). When the hook blocks a command, rewrite — don't bypass.

Behavior the hook can't catch: redact `token` / `jwt` / `access_token` / `refresh_token` / `api_key` / `secret` / `password` / `authorization` fields when citing API responses. Show key _names_ only when displaying `.env.local`. If a user pastes a secret, treat it as compromised and ask them to rotate.

Full hook spec in [`.claude/hooks/token-guard/README.md`](.claude/hooks/token-guard/README.md).

## 🏗️ CLI-Specific

### Commands

- **Build**: `pnpm run build` (smart) | `--force` | `pnpm run build:cli` | `pnpm run build:sea`
- **Test**: `pnpm test` (monorepo root) | `pnpm --filter @socketsecurity/cli run test:unit <path>`
- **Lint**: `pnpm run lint` | **Type check**: `pnpm run type` | **Check all**: `pnpm run check`
- **Fix**: `pnpm run fix` | **Dev**: `pnpm dev` (watch) | **Run built**: `node packages/cli/dist/index.js <args>`

### Testing

- 🚨 **NEVER use `--` before test file paths** — runs ALL tests
- Always build before testing: `pnpm run build:cli`
- Update snapshots: `pnpm testu <path>` or `--update` flag
- NEVER write source-code-scanning tests — verify behavior, not string patterns

### Command Pattern

- Simple (<200 LOC, no subcommands): single `cmd-*.mts`
- Complex: `cmd-*.mts` + `handle-*.mts` + `output-*.mts` + `fetch-*.mts`

### Codex Usage

Advice and critical assessment ONLY — never for making code changes. Consult before complex optimizations (>30min).
